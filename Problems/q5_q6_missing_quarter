### Q6. Find max gap of missing quarter

## Solution : 
	SELECT store, start_qtr, end_qtr FROM
	(SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY store ORDER BY diff_qtr desc)my_rank
	FROM
	(SELECT store,quarter as end_qtr, lag(quarter,1) OVER (partition by store order by quarter) as start_qtr, quarter- 
	lag(quarter,1) OVER (partition by store order by quarter) as diff_qtr
	FROM
	(SELECT * FROM `sabermetrics-ai.MLB.hitter_consec_qtr`
	UNION ALL 
	SELECT distinct(store) as store, 0 as quarter, 0 as sales FROM `sabermetrics-ai.MLB.hitter_consec_qtr`
	UNION ALL
	SELECT distinct(store) as store, 31 as quarter, 0 as sales FROM `sabermetrics-ai.MLB.hitter_consec_qtr`
	ORDER BY store,quarter)a))b
	WHERE my_rank = 1
	
	
	
### Q5. Find start and end of missing quarter sequence for each store

## Solution : 
	SELECT store, missing_start_qtr + 1 as missing_start_qtr, missing_end_qtr - 1 as missing_end_qtr
	FROM
	(SELECT store,quarter as missing_end_qtr, lag(quarter,1) OVER (partition by store order by quarter) as missing_start_qtr, quarter- 
	lag(quarter,1) OVER (partition by store order by quarter) as diff_qtr
	FROM
	(SELECT * FROM `sabermetrics-ai.MLB.hitter_consec_qtr`
	UNION ALL 
	SELECT distinct(store) as store, 0 as quarter, 0 as sales FROM `sabermetrics-ai.MLB.hitter_consec_qtr`
	UNION ALL
	SELECT distinct(store) as store, 31 as quarter, 0 as sales FROM `sabermetrics-ai.MLB.hitter_consec_qtr`
	ORDER BY store,quarter)a)
	WHERE diff_qtr>1
	ORDER BY 1,2
