Table : rolling_sum
app_id,date,usage_h (usage_hours)

Q. Find 7 day rolling sum of usage hours per app_id,date

# using window function using frame

SELECT app_id,Date,
sum(usage_h) over (partition by app_id order by Date  ROWS between 6 preceding  and current row) as rolling
FROM rolling_sum
group by 1,2


# using self join

select b.app_id,b.Date, sum(a.usage_h) as summation
from rolling_sum a inner join rolling_sum b
on b.Date - a.Date  BETWEEN 0 and 6 and a.app_id=b.app_id
group by 1,2
