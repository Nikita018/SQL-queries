Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. Write a query to print the contest_id, hacker_id, name, and the sums of total_submissions, total_accepted_submissions, total_views, and total_unique_views for each contest sorted by contest_id. Exclude the contest from the result if all four sums are .

Note: A specific contest can be used to screen candidates at more than one college, but each college only holds  screening contest.

SOLUTION

SELECT a.contest_id, hacker_id, name, sum(tot_sub) as tot_sub, sum(acc_sub) as acc_sub, sum(tot_view) as tot_view, sum(uniq_view) as uniq_view
FROM Contests d
LEFT JOIN

FROM Colleges coll
JOIN Challenges chal
ON coll.college_id = chal.college_id
GROUP BY contest_id, challenge_id) b

GROUP BY a.contest_id, hacker_id, name 
having sum(tot_sub)+sum(acc_sub)+sum(tot_view)+sum(uniq_view) > 0
Order by a.contest_id
