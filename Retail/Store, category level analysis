 Question
 
 Table 1 : sales_info
 Store_no, visit_no, visit_date, cust_id, scan_id, quantity, sales
 
 Table 2 : category_info
 scan_id, cat_no
 
 Find the biggest category with respect to number of distinct items sold for every store, and also based on sales amount, and based on distinct customer reach
 
 1. Biggest category wrt Number of distinct items sold
 
 
 SELECT store_no, cat_no
 FROM
 (SELECT store_no, cat_no, 
 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY store_no ORDER BY distinct_item)cat_rank
 FROM
 (SELECT store_no, cat_no, count(*) as distinct_item
 FROM
 (SELECT store_no, cat_no, scan_id 
 FROM sales_info s
 INNER JOIN category_info c
 ON s.scan_id=c.scan_id
 WHERE sales > 0
 GROUP BY 1,2,3)x
 GROUP BY 1,2)y)z
 WHERE cat_rank = 1
 
 
 2. Sales amount
 
 SELECT store_no, cat_no
 FROM
 (SELECT store_no, cat_no,
 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY store_no ORDER BY cat_sales)cat_rank
 FROM
 (SELECT store_no, cat_no, sum(sales) as cat_sales
 FROM sales_info s
 INNER JOIN category_info c
 ON s.scan_id=c.scan_id
 GROUP BY 1,2)x)y
 WHERE cat_rank=1
 
 3. Biggest category wrt distinct customers
 
 SELECT store_no, cat_no
 FROM
 (SELECT store_no, cat_no,
 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY store_no ORDER BY distinct_cust)cat_rank
 FROM
 (SELECT store_no, cat_no, count(*) as distinct_cust
 FROM
 (SELECT store_no, cat_no, cust_id, sum(sales) as sum_sales 
 FROM sales_info s
 INNER JOIN category_info c
 ON s.scan_id=c.scan_id
 WHERE sales > 0
 GROUP BY 1,2,3
 HAVING sum_sales>0)x
 GROUP BY 1,2)y)z
 WHERE cat_rank=1
